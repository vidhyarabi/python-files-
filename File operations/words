Write Write a function called sort_words that takes a string of words as an argument, removes the whitespaces,
and returns a list of letters sorted in alphabetical order. Letters will be separated by commas.
All letters should appear once in the list. This means that you sort and remove duplicates.
For example 'love life' should return as ['e,f,i,l,o,v'].
